# Spelunky Classic HD HTML5

HTML5 version of [Spelunky Classic HD](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD).

**This project is currently not in sync with the [parent project](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD). For some reason, the HTML5 export failed in the latest version of GameMaker. I havenâ€™t been able to identify the root cause yet.**

This version has a bit more bugs but also it has some nice features:
- you can play it in [your browser](https://yancharkin.github.io/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/)
- [builds for macOS, 64 bits builds for Linux and Windows, ARM builds for Linux (Electron)](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)
- touch input on any device that supports it (not only android)
